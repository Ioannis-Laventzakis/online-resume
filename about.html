<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Ioannis! I’m someone who loves building things and figuring out how stuff works. I enjoy taking on challenges and turning ideas into something real and exciting.</p>
<p>When I’m not working, I’m busy being a dad to two wonderful kids who bring a lot of joy (and a bit of chaos!) to my life. I like exploring new hobbies, trying out fun projects, and learning something new every day.</p>
